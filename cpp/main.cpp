  //TODO 1. DONE. Get flow directions for all cells. 

  //TODO 2. Perform a flow accumulation moving water downhill and filling
  //groundwater as you go. Look at `misc/main.cpp`. Recall that we did this by
  //counting depressions, finding peaks, and using a queue to control a breadth-
  //first traversal from the peaks downwards.

  //TODO 3. As part of the above, when flow can't go downhill any farther, add
  //it to the `water_vol` for the appropriate depression. Use the labels array
  //to determine the appropriate depression.

  //TODO 4/5. Perform a depth-first post-order traversal of the depression
  //hierarchy (start with depressions for which `parent==NO_PARENT`. When you
  //reach the leaves if `water_vol>dep_vol` then try to overflow into the
  //neighbouring depression if its `water_vol<dep_vol`. To do so search
  //neighbour cells of `out_cell` for the lowest cell labeled `odep` and follow
  //that one's flow path until it terminates. Add excess water to that
  //depression's `water_vol`. After both child depressions have been visited
  //they will be finished trying to share their water and their excess water is
  //added to their parent's `water_vol`. Repeat the overflow attempt.

  //TODO 6: Adjust the hydrologic elevations. If a depression has `water_vol>0`
  //then all of its child depression are full. What remains is to use a
  //priority-queue and the Water Level Equation (see dephier.cpp) to find which
  //cells should be flooded. If a depression is a leaf depression (no children)
  //then start the PQ at the pit_cell. Otherwise, start at the pit cell of any
  //child depression since all children are flooded to at least the level of the
  //`out_elev` connecting the uppermost two children in the hierarchy. Cells
  //should be added to the queue with elevation equal to at least the `out_elev`
  //of the depression's children and, if `water_vol<dep_vol` should not exceed
  //the `out_elev` of the depression itself.
