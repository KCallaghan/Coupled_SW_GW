  //sides. The depression then contains its pit cell, its outlet, every cell
  //below its outlet, and possibly many cells above its outlet which ultimately
  //drain into its pit cell. (Though note that if the depression has a flat

  //other depressions. That is, we need to build a hierarchy of depressions.

  //Since outlets link two depressions, any time we have an outlet we can form a

  //of the outlet linking its two children.

  //Since each depression has one and only one parent and at most two children,
  //the depressions will form a binary tree.

  //In order to build the depression hierarchy, it is convenient to visit
  //outlets from lowest to highest.
